**Women Safety Analysis**
This is a Mini Project aimed at enhancing women's safety by providing features such as:

*Safe Zones*: Integration with maps to highlight safe zones and alert users about danger-prone areas in real-time.
*Emergency Alerts*: Notifications and alerts to notify trusted contacts or authorities during emergencies.
*Real-Time Updates*: Stay informed with live updates on safety conditions.

Current Implementation
For notification alerts, we have implemented the Vontage API (selected because it offers free credit points for testing purposes). However, the project is flexible, and you can use any other SMS or email notification API that suits your needs.

Work in Progress
This project is actively being developed, and we welcome any contributions, suggestions, or improvements!
